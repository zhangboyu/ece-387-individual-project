(Arduino Mega code: "final_project_kinect_tetris.ino")(This code is the same code found in our group project, which has all the functionalities. Both Kinect and accelerometer can be used to play the tetris. But Kinect and Processing are required to start the game.)

(Arduino Mega code: "arduino_tetris.ino")(This code is an independent version of my project, which does not require Kinect and Processing to start the game. However, the game can only be controlled by accelerometer, not Kinect.)

==1.General information about this project.==

In this project, I built a tetris game based on Arduino Mega 2560, TFT touch screen, accelerometer, 8*8 LED matrix, and Kinect (optional). The idea to make a game on the LED matrix and accelerometer was came from one of the former students. He built a Snake game based on LED matrix and accelerometer for his individual project.
