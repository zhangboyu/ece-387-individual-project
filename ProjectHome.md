I made a tetris game on 8\*8 LED matrix for my individual project. In this game, you can select different level from the touch screen. Different level corresponding to different falling speed and different number of randomly created row at the bottom of the screen. The move of the "shape" can be controlled by gyro and kinect. Your score will show on the screen, and the highest score will be kept. At the end of the game, an animation will shown on the LED matrix to indicate gameover.
